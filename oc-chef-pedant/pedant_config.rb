# This annotated Pedant configuration file details the various
# configuration settings available to you.  It is separate from the
# actual Pedant::Config class because not all settings have sane
# defaults, and not all settings are appropriate in all settings.
#
# The defaults in this file are designed to work out of the box when developing
# Chef Server 12+ using the "Dev VM" tool, but they should work in other
# contexts as long as the Chef Server is running on localhost.

# A unique identification string used to create orgs and users specific
# to a each single chef server's nodes' OS. Simply using "Process.pid"
# proved to not be unique enough when running pedant simultaneously
# on multiple nodes of the same chef server when the generated pedant
# config file could have been copied across during the setup of that
# chef server.
chef_server_uid = "private-chef_#{Process.pid}"

# Specify a testing organization if you are testing a multi-tenant
# instance of a Chef Server (e.g., Private Chef, Hosted Chef).  If you
# are testing a single-tenant instance (i.e. Open Source Chef Server),
# DO NOT include this parameter
#
# Due to how the current org cache operates, it is best to use a
# unique name for your testing organization. If you do not use a
# unique name and run tests several times (destroying the organization
# between runs) you will likely get inconsistent results.
#
# If you wish Pedant to create the organization for you at test time,
# include the `:create_me => true` pair.  If you wish to use an
# existing organization for tests, you should supply a `:validator_key
# => "/full/path/to/key.pem"` pair
org({:name => "pedant_testorg_#{chef_server_uid}",
     :create_me => true})

#      :validator_key => "/etc/opscode/existing_org-validator.pem"})

# If you want Pedant to delete the testing organization when it is
# done, use this parameter.  Note that this only has an effect if
# Pedant also created the testing organization.
delete_org true

# You MUST specify the address of the server the API requests will be
# sent to.  Only specify protocol, hostname, and port.
chef_server "https://#{`hostname -f`.strip}"

# This configration specifies the default orgname. Note that it does *not*
# mean that Pedant will test things with default org urls. To do that,
# pass --use-default-org on the command line
default_orgname nil

# If you are doing development testing, you can specify the address of
# the Solr server.  The presence of this parameter will enable tests
# to force commits to Solr, greatly decreasing the amout of time
# needed for testing the search endpoint.  This is only an
# optimization for development!  If you are testing a "live" Chef
# Server, or otherwise do not have access to the Solr server from your
# testing location, you should not specify a value for this parameter.
# The tests will still run, albeit slower, as they will now need to
# poll for a period to ensure they are querying committed results.
search_server "http://127.0.0.1:8983"

# Related to the 'search_server' parameter, this specifies the maximum
# amout of time (in seconds) that search endpoint requests should be
# retried before giving up.  If not explicitly set, it will default to
# 65 seconds; only set it if you know that your Solr commit interval
# differs significantly from this.
maximum_search_time 65

# We're starting to break tests up into groups based on different
# criteria.  The proper API tests (the results of which are viewable
# to OPC customers) should be the only ones run by Pedant embedded in
# OPC installs.  There are other specs that help us keep track of API
# cruft that we want to come back and fix later; these shouldn't be
# viewable to customers, but we should be able to run them in
# development and CI environments.  If this parameter is missing or
# explicitly `false` only the customer-friendly tests will be run.
#
# This is mainly here for documentation purposes, since the
# command-line `opscode-pedant` utility ultimately determines this
# value.
