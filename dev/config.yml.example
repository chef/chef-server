# See defaults.yml for a list of supported configuration values. Any simple value
# will override the defaults.yml setting.  Hashes will be recursively merged.
# A value containing arrays/lists will be merged and made unique.
#
# If the value you have differs in type (eg, is a simple value when
# defaults.yml has a hash or array or vice-versa) your value will overwrite
# the original - use this with caution.
#
# Currently hashes nested within arrays are not supported - the higher-level
# behavior of naively merging the arrays will occur.
