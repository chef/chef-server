# We use the nokogiri gem in the project,

# at the time we're building oc_id, and so fails.
# We add nokogiri as a dep because it's a direct dependency,
# and makeds more sense than adding the thing that is stopping
# it from building on s390 (libxml2).

# We used to require nodejs-binary and build the assets in the
# pipeline, but now require the developer to build and commit assets
# with any change.  This was done mostly due to the lack of support
# for nodejs on PPC64BE platforms.
