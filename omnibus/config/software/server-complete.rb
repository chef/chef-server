# libiconv (unicode character conversion library) was originally
# a dependency declared in several components out of omnibus-software.
# It was recently removed (2017Q1) from most of these components as a dep, and
# build flags were updated to not link it into the components.
#
# This led to chef-server no longer pulling it indirectly. This broke popt, which
# is defined upstream and pulled in by logrotate.
#
# TODO mp 2017-04-06 - a little further digging to see if the right answer is to
#                      conditionally add the dependency for popt on s390x.

# These are roughly sorted by build time and change frequency,
