# secrets have been rotated. It's important to note that credential rotation
# does not rotate the pivotal, user or client keys, or remove any Chef Server
# policy or cookbooks that have been uploaded. When the user rotates the shared
# credentials the chef-client reconfigure run will re-enable/link the services,
# restart the Chef Server and remove the sentinel file that enables the
