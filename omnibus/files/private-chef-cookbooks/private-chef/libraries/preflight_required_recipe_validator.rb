        The required_recipe file must be owned by root. Please change the owner to root
        and reconfigure the Chef server:

            chown root:root #{@required_recipe['path']}

        The required_recipe file must be in the root group. Please change the group to
        root and reconfigure the Chef server:

            chown root:root #{@required_recipe['path']}

        The required_recipe must have a mode of 644 or 600. Please set a compatible mode
        and reconfigure the Chef server:

            chmod 600 #{@required_recipe['path']}
            #{Chef::Dist::Server::CTL} reconfigure
      EOF
