# A unique identification string used to create orgs and users specific
# to a each single chef server's nodes' OS. Simply using "Process.pid"
# proved to not be unique enough when running pedant simultaneously
# on multiple nodes of the same chef server when the generated pedant
# config file could have been copied across during the setup of that
# chef server.

# instance of a Chef Server (e.g., Private Chef, Hosted Chef).  If you
# are testing a single-tenant instance (i.e. Open Source Chef Server),
# DO NOT include this parameter
#
# Due to how the current org cache operates, it is best to use a
# unique name for your testing organization. If you do not use a
# unique name and run tests several times (destroying the organization
# between runs) you will likely get inconsistent results.
#
# If you wish Pedant to create the organization for you at test time,
# include the `:create_me => true` pair.  If you wish to use an
# existing organization for tests, you should supply a `:validator_key
# => "/full/path/to/key.pem"` pair

# If you are doing development testing, you can specify the address of
# the Solr server.  The presence of this parameter will enable tests
# to force commits to Solr, greatly decreasing the amout of time
# needed for testing the search endpoint.  This is only an
# optimization for development!  If you are testing a "live" Chef
# Server, or otherwise do not have access to the Solr server from your
# testing location, you should not specify a value for this parameter.
# The tests will still run, albeit slower, as they will now need to
# poll for a period to ensure they are querying committed results.

# Related to the 'search_server' parameter, this specifies the maximum

# differs significantly from this.

# We're starting to break tests up into groups based on different
# criteria.  The proper API tests (the results of which are viewable
# to OPC customers) should be the only ones run by Pedant embedded in
# OPC installs.  There are other specs that help us keep track of API
# cruft that we want to come back and fix later; these shouldn't be
# viewable to customers, but we should be able to run them in
# development and CI environments.  If this parameter is missing or
# explicitly `false` only the customer-friendly tests will be run.
#
# This is mainly here for documentation purposes, since the
# command-line `oc-chef-pedant` utility ultimately determines this

# are using pre-existing users, you must supply a ':key_file' key,
