The Chef Infra Server API is a REST API that provides access to objects on the Chef Infra Server, including nodes, environments, roles, users, organizations, cookbooks (and cookbook versions), and is used to manage an API client list and
the associated RSA public key-pairs.

## Requirements

The Chef Infra Server API has the following requirements:

- The `Accept` header must be set to `application/json`.
- For `PUT` and `POST` requests, the `Content-Type` header must be set to `application/json`.
- The `X-Chef-Version` header must be set to the version of the Chef Infra Server API that is being used.
- A request must be signed by adding authentication headers. 'Mixlib::Authentication' may be used to sign requests.
- A request must be well-formatted. The easiest way to ensure a well-formatted request is to use the `Chef::ServerAPI` library.

## Authentication Headers

Authentication to the Chef Infra Server requires a specific set of HTTP headers signed using a private key associated with the
client making the request. The request is authorized if the Chef Infra Server can verify the signature using the public key. Only
authorized actions are allowed.

{{< note >}}

Most authentication requests made to the Chef Infra Server are abstracted from the user. Such as when using a *knife* or the Chef Infra
Server user interface. In some cases, such as when using the `knife exec` subcommand, the authentication requests need to be made
more explicitly, but still in a way that does not require authentication headers. In a few cases, such as using arbitrary Ruby code, a Chef Infra Server API client, or cURL, it may be necessary to include the full authentication header as part of the request to the Chef Infra Server.

{{< /note >}}

### Required Headers

The following authentication headers are required:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 24%" />
<col style="width: 75%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>Accept</code></td>
<td>The format in which response data from the Chef Infra Server is provided. This header must be set to <code>application/json</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Content-Type</code></td>
<td>The format in which data is sent to the Chef Infra Server. This header is required for <code>PUT</code> and <code>POST</code> requests and must be set to <code>application/json</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Host</code></td>
<td>The host name (and port number) to which a request is sent. (Port number <code>80</code> does not need to be specified.) For example: <code>api.chef.io</code> (which is the same as <code>api.chef.io:80</code>) or <code>api.chef.io:443</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Method</code></td>
<td>The method from the request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>Path</code></td>
<td>Omit for Authentication Version 1. Specify for Authentication Version 1.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>X-Chef-Version</code></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>X-Ops-Authorization-N</code></td>
<td>One (or more) 60 character segments that comprise the canonical header. A canonical header is signed with the private key used by the client machine from which the request is sent, and is also encoded using Base64. If more than one segment is required, each should be named sequentially, e.g. <code>X-Ops-Authorization-1</code>, <code>X-Ops-Authorization-2</code>, <code>X-Ops-Authorization-N</code>, where <code>N</code> represents the integer used by the last header that is part of the request.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version</code></td>
<td>Use <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version</code> to specify the version of the Chef Infra Server API. For example: <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version: 1</code>. <code>X-Ops-Server-API-Version: 0</code> is supported for use with Chef Infra Server version 12, but will be deprecated as part of the next major release.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>X-Ops-Sign</code></td>
<td>Set this header to the following value: <code>algorithm=sha1,version=1.0</code> or <code>version=1.3</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>X-Ops-Timestamp</code></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>X-Ops-UserId</code></td>
<td>The name of the API client whose private key will be used to create the authorization header.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

{{< note >}}

Use `X-Ops-Server-API-Info` to identify the version of the Chef Infra Server API.

#### Canonical Header Format 1.0 using SHA-1

The signed headers are encrypted using the OpenSSL RSA_private_encrypt method and encoded in Base64.  The signed headers are used to create one or more X-Ops-Authorization-N headers of 60 character segments. The canonical header should be created by concatenating the following headers, encrypting and encoding:

```none
Method:HTTP_METHOD
Hashed Path:HASHED_PATH
X-Ops-Content-Hash:HASHED_BODY
X-Ops-Timestamp:TIME
X-Ops-UserId:USERID
```

where:

-   `HTTP_METHOD` is the method used in the API request (`GET`, `POST`, and so on)
-   `HASHED_PATH` is the path of the request:
    `/organizations/NAME/name_of_endpoint`. The `HASHED_PATH` must be hashed using SHA-1 and encoded using Base64, must not have repeated forward slashes (`/`), must not end in a forward slash (unless the path is `/`), and must not include a query string.
-   `X-Ops-Content-Hash` is the Base64 encoded SHA256 hash of the json body of the request.
-   `X-Ops-Timestamp` UTC time in RFC3339 format.
-   `X-Ops-UserId` is the plain text client or user name.

The Chef Infra Server decrypts this header and ensures its content matches the content of the non-encrypted headers in the request. The timestamp of the message is checked to ensure the request was received within a reasonable amount of time. One approach to generating the signed headers is to use [mixlib-authentication](https://github.com/chef/mixlib-authentication), a class-based header signing authentication object similar to the one used by Chef Infra Client.

##### Example

The following example shows an authentication request:

```none
GET /organizations/NAME/nodes HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3
  Host: api.chef.io:443
  User-Agent: Chef Knife/12.0.2 (ruby-2.1.1-p320; ohai-8.0.0; x86_64-darwin12.0.2; +http://chef.io)
  X-Chef-Version: 12.0.2
  X-Ops-Authorization-1: BE3NnBritishaf3ifuwLSPCCYasdfXaRN5oZb4c6hbW0aefI
  X-Ops-Authorization-2: sL4j1qtEZzi/2WeF67UuytdsdfgbOc5CjgECQwqrym9gCUON

  X-Ops-Content-Hash: 2jmj7l5rfasfgSw0ygaVb/vlWAghYkK/YBwk=
  X-Ops-Server-API-Info: 1
  X-Ops-Sign: algorithm=sha1;version=1.0;
  X-Ops-Userid: user_id
  X-Ops-Timestamp: 2014-12-12T17:13:28Z
```

#### Canonical Header Format 1.3 using SHA-256

Chef Infra Server versions 12.4.0 and above support signing protocol version 1.3, which supports for SHA-256 algorithms. It can be enabled on Chef Infra Client via the `client.rb` file:

```ruby
authentication_protocol_version = '1.3'
```

And for Chef's knife CLI via `config.rb`:

```ruby
knife[:authentication_protocol_version] = '1.3'
```

To create the signed headers for direct use. Gather the following headers in the order listed, convert the signature headers to a concatenated string, sign and Base64 encode the result. The concatenation of signature headers is signed using the client RSA private key, with SHA-256 hashing and PKCS1v15 padding. Chop the Base64 encoded value into 60 character chunks and create X-Ops-Authorization-N headers with the chunks.

```none
Method:HTTP_METHOD
Path:PATH
X-Ops-Content-Hash:HASHED_BODY
X-Ops-Sign
X-Ops-Timestamp:TIME
X-Ops-UserId:USERID
X-Ops-Server-API-Version
```

where:

- `HTTP_METHOD` is the method used in the API request (`GET`, `POST`, ...)
- `PATH` is the path of the request: `/organizations/NAME/name_of_endpoint`. The value must not have repeated forward slashes (`/`), must not end in a forward slash (unless the path is `/`), and must not include a query string.
- `X-Ops-Content-Hash` is the Base64 encoded SHA256 hash of the json body of the request.
- `X-Ops-Sign` has the value "version=1.3".
- `X-Ops-Timestamp` UTC time in RFC3339 format.
- `X-Ops-UserId` is the plain text client or user name.
- `X-Ops-Server-API-Version` is the numeric value of the Chef Infra Server API.

##### Example

The following example shows an authentication request:

```none

### Knife API Requests

{{< readfile file="content/reusable/md/plugin_knife_summary.md" >}}

{{< readfile file="content/server/reusable/md/plugin_knife_using_authenticated_requests.md" >}}

## Global Endpoints

A global endpoint may be used to access all the organizations on the Chef Infra Server.

### /authenticate_user

The `/authenticate_user` endpoint has the following methods: `POST`.

#### POST

The `POST` method is used to authenticate a user. This endpoint is used by the Chef Identity Service to authenticate users of Chef Supermarket to the Chef Infra Server. This method has no parameters.

**Request**

```none
POST /authenticate_user
```

with a request body similar to:

```javascript
{
  "username" : "grantmc",
  "password" : "p@ssw0rd"
}
```

**Response**

This method has no response body.

**Response Codes**

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 80%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Response Code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>200</code></td>
<td>OK. The request was successful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>401</code></td>
<td>Unauthorized. The user or client who made the request could not be authenticated. Verify the user/client name, password, and that the correct key was used to sign the request.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### /license

{{< note >}}

This endpoint is used for information purposes only and to trigger a notification in the Chef management console about the number of licenses owned vs. the number of licenses that should be owned. No other action is taken, and the functionality and behavior of the Chef Infra Server and any added component do not change.

{{< /note >}}

The `/license` endpoint has the following methods: `GET`.

#### GET

The `GET` method is used to get license information for the Chef Infra Server. This method has no parameters.

**Request**

```none
GET /license
```

This method has no request body.

**Response**

The response is similar to:

```javascript
{
  "limit_exceeded": false,
  "node_license": 25,
  "node_count": 12,
  "upgrade_url": "https://www.chef.io/pricing"
}
```

When `node_count` is greater than `node_license`, then `limit_exceeded` is `true`, and the Chef management console will display a notification about this status. The way to resolve this is to visit the upgrade URL, add the appropriate number of licenses, and then update the configuration settings appropriately.

The chef-server.rb file contains settings that can be used to edit the number of nodes that are under license:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 80%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Setting</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>license['nodes']</code></td>
<td>The number of licensed nodes. Default value: <code>25</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>license['upgrade_url']</code></td>

### /users

A user is an individual account that is created to allow access to the Chef Infra Server. For example:

- A hosted Chef Infra Server account
- The user that operates the workstation from which a Chef Infra Server will be managed

The `/users` endpoint has the following methods: `GET` and `POST`.

{{< warning >}}

This endpoint may only be accessed by the `pivotal` user, which is created as part of the installation process for the Chef Infra Server. (See the "Query for Users and Orgs" example below for an example of how to access this endpoint with the `pivotal` user.)

{{< /warning >}}

{{< note >}}

This documentation for the `/users` endpoint is for version 1 of the Chef Infra Server API.  Version 0 of the API has some differences in the request body and in the results.

{{< /note >}}

#### GET

The `GET` method is used to get a list of users on the Chef Infra Server.

This method has the following parameters:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 40%" />
<col style="width: 60%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>email=jane@chef.com</code></td>
<td>Filter the users returned based on their email id.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>external_authentication_uid=jane@chef.com</code></td>
<td>Filter the users returned based on their external login id.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>verbose=true</code></td>
<td>Returns a user list with "email", "first_name", "last_name" fields. If this flag is set the email and external_authentication_uid parameters are ignored.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Request**

```none
GET /users
```

**Response**

The response is similar to:

```none
{
  "user1": "https://chef.example/users/user1",
  "user2": "https://chef.example/users/user2"
}
```

The verbose response is similar to:

```none
{
  "janechef": { "email": "jane.chef@user.com", "first_name": "jane", "last_name": "chef_user" },
  "yaelsmith": { "email": "yeal.chef@user.com", "first_name": "yeal", "last_name": "smith" }
}
```

**Response Codes**

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%" />
<col style="width: 80%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Response Code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>200</code></td>
<td>OK. The request was successful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>401</code></td>
<td>Unauthorized. The user or client who made the request could not be authenticated. Verify the user/client name, and that the correct key was used to sign the request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Forbidden. The user who made the request is not authorized to perform the action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>404</code></td>
<td>Not found. The requested object does not exist.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Optional Filtering**

Filtering on `/users` can be done with the `external_authentication_uid`. This is to support SAML authentication.

As an example, to retrieve users whos `external_authentication_uid` is `jane@doe.com`, you would do the following:

```none
GET /users?external_authentication_uid=jane%40doe.com
```

#### POST

The `POST` method is used to create a user on the Chef Infra Server.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

```none
POST /users
```

with a request body similar to:

```javascript
{
  "username": "robert-forster",
  "display_name": "robert",
  "email": "robert@noreply.com",
  "first_name": "robert",
  "last_name": "forster",
  "middle_name": "",
  "password": "yeahpass",
  "create_key": true,
  "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAoYyN0AIhUh7Fw1+gQtR+ \n0/HY3625IUlVheoUeUz3WnsTrUGSSS4fHvxUiCJlNni1sQvcJ0xC9Bw3iMz7YVFO\nWz5SeKmajqKEnNywN8/NByZhhlLdBxBX/UN04/7aHZMoZxrrjXGLcyjvXN3uxyCO\nyPY989pa68LJ9jXWyyfKjCYdztSFcRuwF7tWgqnlsc8pve/UaWamNOTXQnyrQ6Dp\ndn+1jiNbEJIdxiza7DJMH/9/i/mLIDEFCLRPQ3RqW4T8QrSbkyzPO/iwaHl9U196\n06Ajv1RNnfyHnBXIM+I5mxJRyJCyDFo/MACc5AgO6M0a7sJ/sdX+WccgcHEVbPAl\n1wIDAQAB \n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n\n"
}
```

where:

- `username` must begin with a lower-case letter or digit, may only contain lower-case letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores. For
    example: `chef`. `username` is required to be present and have a valid value. A valid username is a dot separated list of elements matching `` a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~- ``.
- `display_name` is required to be present.
- `email` is required to be present and have a valid value. The email validation doesn't allow for all unicode characters.
- Either `external_authentication_uid` or `password` are required to be present and have a value.
- During the POST, the `public_key` value will be broken out and resubmitted to the keys portion of the API in the latest Chef Infra Server versions.
- Only one of the keys, `create_key` or `public_key`, may be specified.  If `create_key` is specified, a default private key is generated and returned.

**Response**

The response is similar to:

```javascript
{
  "uri": "https://chef.example/users/robert-forster",
  "chef_key": {
    "name": "default",
    "public_key": "-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY...",

</tbody>
</table>

#### PUT

The `PUT` method updates a specific user. If values are not specified for the `PUT` method, the Chef Infra Server will use the existing values rather than assign default values.

{{< note >}}

`PUT` supports renames. If `PUT /users/foo` is requested with `{ "username: "bar""}`, then it will rename `foo` to `bar` and all of the
content previously associated with `foo` will be associated with `bar`.

{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}

As of 12.1.0, the `"public_key"`, `"private_key"`, and `"create_key"` parameters in PUT requests to clients/users will cause a 400 response.

The clients should be managed using a knife as opposed to the Chef Infra Server API. The interactions between clients, , and acls are tricky.

{{< /note >}}

#### GET

The `GET` method is used to return a client list on the Chef Infra Server, including clients for nodes that have been registered with the Chef Infra Server, the chef-validator clients, and the chef-server-webui clients for the entire organization. This method has no parameters.

**Request**

```none
GET /organizations/NAME/clients
```

This method has no request body.

**Response**

The response is similar to:

```javascript

#### POST

The `POST` method is used to create a new API client.

{{< note >}}

As of 12.1.0, the `"admin"` parameter is no longer supported in client/user creation and support. If used in the `POST` or `PUT` of a
client or user, the `"admin"` parameter is ignored.

{{< /note >}}

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

```none
POST /organizations/NAME/clients
```

with a request body similar to:

```javascript
{
  "name": "name_of_API_client",

#### PUT

The `PUT` method updates a specific client. If values are not specified for the `PUT` method, the Chef Infra Server will use the existing values rather than assign default values.

{{< note >}}

`PUT` supports renames. If `PUT /client/foo` is requested with `{ "name: "bar""}`, then it will rename `foo` to `bar` and all of the
content previously associated with `foo` will be associated with `bar`.

{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}

As of 12.1.0, the `"admin"` parameter is no longer supported in client/user creation and support. If used in the `POST` or `PUT` of a
client or user, then it is ignored.

{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}

As of 12.1.0, including `"public_key"`, `"private_key"`, or `"create_key"` in PUT requests to clients/users will cause a 400
response.

{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}

`"name"` and `"clientname"` are not independent values. Making a PUT request with different values will return a 400 error. Either name
may be specified to set both values.

{{< /note >}}

PUT /organizations/NAME/clients/NAME
```

### /cookbooks

{{< readfile file="content/reusable/md/cookbooks_summary.md" >}}

When a cookbook is uploaded, only files that are new or updated is included. This approach minimizes the amount of storage and time that is required during the modify-upload-test cycle. Chef Infra Client uses a checksum and assigns a checksum to each file to keep track of which files have already been uploaded. These checksums are used in the cookbook version manifest, alongside the same records that store the file description (name, specificity, and so on), as well as the checksum and the URL from which the file's contents can be retrieved.

The `/cookbooks` endpoint has the following methods: `GET`.

#### GET

The `GET` method is used to return a hash of all cookbooks and cookbook versions. This method has the following parameters:

For example: <code>num_versions=3</code> returns the three latest versions, in descending order (newest to oldest). Use <code>num_versions=all</code> to return all cookbook versions. If <code>num_versions</code> is not specified, a single cookbook version is returned. <code>0</code> is an invalid input (an empty array for the versions of each cookbook is returned).</td>

### /search

{{< readfile file="content/reusable/md/search.md" >}}

The `/search` endpoint allows nodes, roles, data bags, environments to be searched. This endpoint has the following methods: `GET`.

{{< note >}}

At the end of every Chef Infra Client run, the node object is saved to the Chef Infra Server. From the Chef Infra Server, each node object is then added to the Apache Solr search index. This process is asynchronous. By default, node objects are committed to the search index every 60 seconds or per 1000 node objects, whichever occurs first.

{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}

This endpoint does not have any ACL restrictions, which means it may be used by any user or client that is able to make the request to the Chef Infra Server.

{{< /note >}}

#### GET

The `GET` method is used to return a data structure that contains links to each available search index. By default, the `role`, `node`,
`client`, and `data bag` indexes will always be available (where the `data bag` index is the name of the data bag on the Chef Infra Server). Search indexes may lag behind the most current data at any given time. If a situation occurs where data needs to be written and then immediately searched, an artificial delay (of at least 10 seconds) is recommended.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

```none
GET /organizations/NAME/search
```

This method has no request body.

**Response**

The response is similar to:

```javascript
{
  "node": "https://chef.example/organizations/org1/search/node",
  "role": "https://chef.example/organizations/org1/search/role",
  "client": "https://chef.example/organizations/org1/search/client",

</tbody>
</table>

#### POST

A partial search query allows a search query to be made against specific attribute keys that are stored on the Chef Infra Server. A partial search query can search the same set of objects on the Chef Infra Server as a full search query, including specifying an object index and providing a query that can be matched to the relevant index. While a full search query will return an array of objects that match (each object containing a full set of attributes for the node), a partial search query will return only the values for the attributes that match. One primary benefit of using a partial search query is that it requires less memory and network bandwidth while Chef Infra Client processes the search results. The attributes to be returned by the partial search are specified in the request JSON body.

## Examples

The following sections show examples of using the Chef Infra Server API.

### Query for Users and Orgs

The following example shows how to query the Chef Infra Server API for a listing of organizations and users. The `/organizations` and `/users` endpoints may only be accessed by the `pivotal` user, which is a user account that is created by Chef during the installation of the Chef Infra Server.

Run the following from a `.chef` directory that contains a `pivotal.rb` file:

```ruby
require 'chef'
require 'chef/server_api'

Chef::Config.from_file('.chef/pivotal.rb')
rest = Chef::ServerAPI.new(Chef::Config[:chef_server_url])
orgs = rest.get('/organizations')

puts "\n=== Listing of organizations"
orgs.each do |org|
  puts org
end

puts "\n=== Listing of Users"
users = rest.get('/users')
users.each do |user|
  puts user
end
```

An example of a `.chef/pivotal.rb` file is shown below:

```ruby
current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
node_name 'pivotal'
chef_server_url 'https://192.0.2.0:443'
chef_server_root 'https://192.0.2.0:443'
client_key "#{current_dir}/pivotal.pem"
```

{{< note >}}

The `pivotal.pem` file must exist in the specified location and the IP
addresses must be correct for the Chef Infra Server.

{{< /note >}}
