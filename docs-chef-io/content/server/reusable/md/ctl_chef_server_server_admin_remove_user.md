The `remove-server-admin-permissions` subcommand is used to remove a
user from the `server-admins` group. Run the command once for each user
removed.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

```bash
chef-server-ctl remove-server-admin-permissions USER_NAME
```

where `USER_NAME` is the user to remove from the list of server
administrators.

For example:

```bash
chef-server-ctl remove-server-admin-permissions bob
```

returns:

```bash
User bob was removed from server-admins. This user can no longer
list, read, and create users for this Chef Infra Server except for where
they have default permissions (such as within an org).
```
