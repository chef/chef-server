The supervisor for the Chef Infra Server is configured to restart any
service that fails, unless that service has been asked to change its
state. The `once` subcommand is used to tell the supervisor to not
attempt to restart any service that fails.

This command is useful when troubleshooting configuration errors that
prevent a service from starting. Run the `once` subcommand followed by
the `status` subcommand to look for services in a down state and/or to
identify which services are in trouble. This command can also be run for
an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the
command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

```bash
chef-server-ctl once SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` represents the name of any service that is listed
after running the `service-list` subcommand.
