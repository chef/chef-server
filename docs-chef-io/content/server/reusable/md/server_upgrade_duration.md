The Chef Infra Server upgrade process requires downtime for stopping the server, installing the new service packages, and then upgrading the server, which will include an automatic OpenSearch/Elasticsearch reindexing operation for existing Elasticsearch/Solr users. We estimate the reindexing operation will take 2 minutes for each 1000 nodes, but it could take more time, depending on your server hardware and the complexity of your Chef data.
