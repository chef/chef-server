The following setting is often modified from the default as part of the
tuning effort for the **opscode-expander** service:

`opscode_expander['nodes']`

:   The number of allowed worker processes. The **opscode-expander**
    service runs on the back-end and feeds data to the **opscode-solr**
    service, which creates and maintains search data used by the Chef
    Infra Server. Additional memory may be required by these worker
    processes depending on the frequency and volume of Chef Infra Client
    runs across the organization, but only if the back-end machines have
    available CPU and RAM. Default value: `2`.
