The `tail` subcommand is used to follow all of the Chef Infra Server
logs for all services. This command can also be run for an individual
service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

```bash
chef-server-ctl tail SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` represents the name of any service that is listed
after running the `service-list` subcommand.
