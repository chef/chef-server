Chef Infra Server 12 and later enables SSL verification by default for all
requests made to the server, such as those made by knife and Chef Infra
Client. The certificate that is generated during the installation of the
Chef Infra Server is self-signed, which means the certificate is not
signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA) recognized by Chef
Infra Client. The certificate generated by the Chef Infra Server must be
downloaded to any machine from which knife and/or Chef Infra Client will
make requests to the Chef Infra Server.

For example, without downloading the SSL certificate, the following
knife command:

```bash
knife client list
```

responds with an error similar to:

```bash
ERROR: SSL Validation failure connecting to host: chef-server.example.com ...
ERROR: OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 ...
```

This is by design and will occur until a verifiable certificate is added
to the machine from which the request is sent.
