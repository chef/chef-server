The following user accounts exist on the Chef Infra Server: `pivotal` (a
superuser account), `alice`, `bob`, `carol`, and `dan`. Run the
following command to view a list of users on the Chef Infra Server:

```bash
chef-server-ctl user-list
```

and it returns the same list of users:

```bash
pivotal
alice
bob
carol
dan
```

Alice is a member of the IT team whose responsibilities include
day-to-day administration of the Chef Infra Server, in particular
managing the user accounts on the Chef Infra Server that are used by the
rest of the organization. From a workstation, Alice runs the following
command:

```bash
knife user list -c ~/.chef/alice.rb
```

and it returns the following error:

```bash
ERROR: You authenticated successfully to <chef_server_url> as alice
       but you are not authorized for this action
Response: Missing read permission
```

Alice is not a superuser and does not have permissions on other users
because user accounts are global to organizations in the Chef Infra
Server. Let's add Alice to the `server-admins` group:

```bash
chef-server-ctl grant-server-admin-permissions alice
```

and it returns the following response:

```bash
User alice was added to server-admins.
```

Alice can now create, read, update, and delete user accounts on the Chef
Infra Server, even for organizations to which Alice is not a member.
From a workstation, Alice re-runs the following command:

```bash
knife user list -c ~/.chef/alice.rb
```

which now returns:

```bash
pivotal
alice
bob
carol
dan
```

Alice is now a server administrator and can use the following knife
subcommands to manage users on the Chef Infra Server:

- `knife user-create`
- `knife user-delete`
- `knife user-edit`
- `knife user-list`
- `knife user-show`

For example, Alice runs the following command:

```bash
knife user edit carol -c ~/.chef/alice.rb
```

and the \$EDITOR opens in which Alice makes changes, and then saves
them.
