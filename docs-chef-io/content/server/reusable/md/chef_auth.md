The Chef Infra Server API handles all communication between Chef Infra Client or Chef Workstation. The Chef Infra Server API is an authenticated REST API, which means all requests require authentication and authorization. The Chef Infra tools such as `knife` and `chef-server` commands use the Chef Infra Server API for you.
