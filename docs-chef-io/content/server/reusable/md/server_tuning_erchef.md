The following settings are often modified from the default as part of
the tuning effort for the **opscode-erchef** service:

`opscode_erchef['db_pool_size']`

:   The number of open connections to PostgreSQL that are maintained by
    the service. If failures indicate that the **opscode-erchef**
    service ran out of connections, try increasing the
    `postgresql['max_connections']` setting. If failures persist, then
    increase this value (in small increments) and also increase the
    value for `postgresql['max_connections']`.

    Default value: `20`.

`opscode_erchef['s3_url_ttl']`

:   The amount of time (in seconds) before connections to the server
    expire. If Chef Infra Client runs are timing out, increase this
    setting to `3600`, and then adjust again if necessary.

    Default value: `900`.

`opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']`

:   {{< readfile file="content/server/reusable/md/settings_strict_search_result_acls.md" >}}
