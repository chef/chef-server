# Directory for Reusable Content
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD002 -->

Files in this directory are used in *more than one place* within the Chef docs.

Store all files in subdirectories organized by file type. For example, all Markdown files should be in `content/<product>/reusable/md/` and all Ruby files are stored in `content/<product>/reusable/rb/`.

Call these files using the [`readfile` shortcode](https://docs.chef.io/style/reuse/#readfile-shortcode).
