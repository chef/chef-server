This is intended to document frequently executed tasks and provide
checklists of TODO's to make sure they are straightforward.

Do *NOT* accept the commit level BuildKite checks as
sufficient. Always do a complete BuildKite build and run of chef
pedant before merge.

## Getting Started
 - Generally all the updates are done inside the dev-vm /host/
   to avoid inconsistensies with ruby versions.
 - stop the sync function if it is running

## Updating Ruby
- omnibus_overrides.rb needs to be updated with the latest acceptable
  version of Ruby.

- Expeditor and BuildKite scripts
  It is best to keep the version we're using for tests the same as
  what we're shipping in Chef Server (match with omnibus_overrides)
    - scripts/bk\_tests/bk\_install.sh
    - .expeditor/verify.pipeline.yml
    - .expeditor/license_scout.sh

- Currently the Habitat plan.sh files use core/ruby; while as of this
  writing (2019-04-04) that is 2.5.5 that floats independently. Be
  aware that this can change, and perhaps consider using core/rubyXX
  instead.

## Updating Ruby Gems via Dependabot (automated)

Dependabot creates PRs for updating Ruby gems.  Verify pipeline builds
are kicked-off automatically, but it is necessary to verify that they
pass.  Any needed adhoc builds must be kicked-off by hand.

Some Dependabot PRs will only need passing verify tests.  Others will
need passing verify tests, adhoc builds, and umbrella tests.  Look at the title of the PR,
then consult the lists below to determine what you need to do with the PR.

Needing passing verify tests only:
- src/oc-id/Gemfile.lock
- src/oc\_erchef/apps/chef_objects/priv/depselector\_rb/Gemfile.lock
- src/oc_bifrost/oc-bifrost-pedant/Gemfile.lock

Needing passing verify + adhoc + umbrella:
- omnibus/Gemfile.lock
- oc-chef-pedant/Gemfile.lock
- src/chef-server-ctl/Gemfile.lock

You can rebase the PR's branch onto main by putting:
`@dependabot rebase`
in the comment section.

## Updating Ruby Gems by Hand

### Overview

To avoid frustration, remove all .bundle and vendor directories before
starting and after you complete the updates.

The following Gemfile.locks need to be updated to do a complete
sweep. We strongly recommend using bundler 1.17.x until bundler 2.1 is
out and stable.

- omnibus/Gemfile.lock
- oc-chef-pedant/Gemfile.lock
- src/oc-id/Gemfile.lock
  You'll need the libsqlite3-dev library if doing this on Ubuntu.
- src/oc\_erchef/apps/chef_objects/priv/depselector\_rb/Gemfile.lock
- src/chef-server-ctl/Gemfile.lock
- src/oc_bifrost/oc-bifrost-pedant/Gemfile.lock

Note:
- omnibus/Gemfile does *not* have a committed Gemfile.lock. We float on
  omnibus-software deliberately to keep up with the latest build
  dependencies.

Note:
- It's best to run
    - bundle install --binstubs --path=vendor/bundle
    - bundle update
  in the appropriate directories to keep your main ruby install
  clean. However do not forget to clean those up before doing an
  omnibus build, as the files there (especially .so files) can cause
  strange build failures, especially during the final consistency checks.

Note:
- On the dev-vm /dotfiles dir is mounted from your host. It is useful for
copying files back from the dev-vm to the host.
- The ./sync utility is used to copy files from the host into dev-vm.

### For Erlangers

Gems are like rebar dependencies, Gemfiles are like rebar.config files,
and Gemfile.lock files are like rebar.lock files. They are located in
directories for particular services the same way rebar config files are.

### Basic Steps to Update a Gem

1) `cd` to the directory containing the Gemfile which needs updating.

2) Rename or otherwise backup and delete the Gemfile.lock.

3) Edit the Gemfile and/or the .gemspec file to update the gem(s).

4) If gems in other directories need updating, go back to step 1,
otherwise proceed.

5) `ssh` into a dev vm.  Do not `sudo -i` or otherwise login as root.

6) `cd` to the directory containing the edited Gemfile and/or .gemspec
file, using /host as the root directory, e.g. /host/src/chef-server-ctl.

7) Remove all .bundle and vendor directories before starting and after you
complete the update:
```
rm -rf vendor
sudo rm -rf .bundle
```
8) Copy over your edited Gemfile and/or .gemspec file(s) (from step 3),
or otherwise make the same edits. chef-server/dev/dotfiles can be used
from your host to copy over files, and /dotfiles on your vm.

9) Run the following to generate a new Gemfile.lock:
```
bundle install --binstubs --path=vendor/bundle
bundle update
```

10) Copy the newly-generated Gemfile.lock back to the appropriate host
directory.

11) If other gems need updating, go back to step 6, otherwise you are
done.

### Steps to Update the PG Gem in chef-server

1) `cd` to the directory containing the .gemspec in chef-server-ctl for PG gem update.

2) Rename or otherwise backup and delete the Gemfile.lock.

3) Edit the .gemspec file to update the PG gem(s).

4) chef-server-ctl depends on PG gem and chef_fixie which also depends on the PG gem.

5) Make sure to update chef_fixie gem in the rubygem.org with same PG gem version otherwise chef-server-ctl fails with dependency conflict error.

5) After publishing the `chef_fixie`, The chef-server gemspec changes can be tested in dev vm

6) `ssh` into a dev vm.  Do `sudo -i` or otherwise login as root.

6) `cd` to the directory containing the edited .gemspec
file, using /host as the root directory, e.g. /host/src/chef-server-ctl.

7) generate .gem file
```
/opt/opscode/embedded/bin/gem build *.gemspec
```
8) install .gem file
```
/opt/opscode/embedded/bin/gem install *.gem
```

## Updating Chef Client

- Ensure that the versions in the following locations are consistent.
    - omnibus_overrides.rb
      You will also need to update Ohai
    - src/chef-server-ctl/chef-server-ctl.gemspec
      Don't forget to update the src/chef-server-ctl/Gemfile.lock

    - src/oc-id/ [leave alone for now]
      chef-client is neededed to provide the Chef Server API.
      We are currently using an old version of chef due to tech debt
      around rails upgrades. We should either fix that debt or find
      another library for the Chef Server API.

    - src/chef-server-ctl/Gemfile.local

- Build Chef Server, and do a chef-server-ctl reconfigure. Fix any new
  warnings about deprecations and the like.

## Updating rebar3

- It is helpful to periodically update the copy of the rebar3 tooling
  that is included with Chef Infra Server.
- The following erlang apps need to be updated:
  - bookshelf
  - oc_erchef
  - oc_bifrost
- Check for the current rebar3 version with `./rebar3 --version`
- Latest version for rebar3 can be found at: https://www.rebar3.org/
- Download and update the current rebar3 executable with it.  If you have wget, you can try the scriptlet below after `cd`ing to your chef-server repo.
```
pushd /tmp
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/rebar3/rebar3 && chmod +x rebar3
popd
cp /tmp/rebar3 src/bookshelf && cp /tmp/rebar3 src/oc_bifrost && cp /tmp/rebar3 src/oc_erchef
```

## Updating Erlang Dependencies using rebar3

- There are 3 approaches to updating the dependencies
  - From the dev-vm (Preferred method)
  - From the host machine by hand (mac in most cases)
  - Automated script
- Updating the erlang deps from the dev-vm
  - cd chef-server/dev
  - vagrant up
  - vagrant ssh
  - In another window/tab on the host machine
    - make changes to the rebar.config if needed
      and run sync to sync the changes with the dev-vm.
    - Make sure to stop the sync after it is complete.
  - In the dev-vm
    - cd /host/src/oc_erchef #Repeat for every erlang app
    - ./rebar3 upgrade
  - This will create an updated rebar.lock file.
  - cp rebar.lock /dotfiles #dotfiles folder is shared on host
  - On the host (mac)
    - cp chef-server/dev/dotfiles/rebar.lock chef-server/src/oc_erchef
  - Repeat the above steps for all the erlang apps.
    - As of 02/21 these are all of the rebar.lock files that need updating:
```
chef-server/src/bookshelf/rebar.lock
chef-server/src/oc_erchef/rebar.lock
chef-server/src/oc_bifrost/rebar.lock
chef-server/src/oc_erchef/apps/data_collector/rebar.lock
```
- Updating the erlang deps from the host machine
  - cd chef-server/src/oc_erchef
  - rm -fr \_build
  - ./rebar3 upgrade
  - rm -fr \_build # not removing this can cause strange build problems where omnibus builds pick up mac architecture libraries
  - The lockfile will be updated in place. .
  - Repeat above steps for all the erlang apps.
    - As of 02/21 these are all of the rebar.lock files that need updating:
```
chef-server/src/bookshelf/rebar.lock
chef-server/src/oc_erchef/rebar.lock
chef-server/src/oc_bifrost/rebar.lock
```
- Automated script

1) Create your new branch in the chef-server repo for upgrading the Erlang dependencies.
```
cd chef-server
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH
```
2) OPTIONAL STEP: Upgrade to the latest rebar3.
```
pushd /tmp
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/rebar3/rebar3 && chmod +x rebar3
popd
cp /tmp/rebar3 src/bookshelf && cp /tmp/rebar3 src/oc_bifrost && cp /tmp/rebar3 src/oc_erchef
git add src/bookshelf/rebar3 src/oc_bifrost/rebar3 src/oc_erchef/rebar3
git commit -sm 'Upgrade rebar3 to X.Y.Z'
```
3) Upgrade the Erlang dependencies using the automated script.  The script upgrades most dependencies, but a few are not updated because upgrading those dependencies creates hex `pkg` references which cause problems for license scout after the upgrade to rebar3 3.20.0.
```
make bump_rebars
```
4) Test compilation locally.  If you have environmental or other issues with local compilation, skip this step and test on buildkite instead.
```
pushd src/bookshelf
./rebar3 compile
popd

pushd src/oc_bifrost
./rebar3 compile
popd

pushd src/oc_erchef
./rebar3 compile
popd
```
5) Commit rebar.locks and push the branch.
```
git add src/bookshelf/rebar.lock src/oc_bifrost/rebar.lock src/oc_erchef/rebar.lock
git commit -sm 'Upgrade Erlang dependencies'
git push
```
6) Test on buildkite.

7) Fix any issues, revert any problem dependencies, etc.

## Buildkite Artifacts (omnibus/adhoc)

Build artifacts are no longer automatically published to artifactory, in order to speed up pipeline runs in cases where artifacts aren't needed.  To publish an artifact in Artifactory's unstable channel, you must first set the Buildkite environment variable `PUBLISH_TO_ARTIFACTORY=true`. (**Buildkite web UI > New Build > Options** opens the Environment Variables settings).

It may be possible to have the artifacts for the nightlies published to artifactory by adding an environment variable to .expeditor/config.yml (untested):

```
diff --git a/.expeditor/config.yml b/.expeditor/config.yml
index 36962f703..ac772214e 100644
--- a/.expeditor/config.yml
+++ b/.expeditor/config.yml
@@ -43,6 +43,7 @@ pipelines:
  - omnibus/adhoc:
       definition: .expeditor/release.omnibus.yml
       env:

   - post-promote:

       definition: .expeditor/post-promote.pipeline.yml
```
On occasion you may encounter a strange or unfamiliar error in the build phase. This may occur on just one platform. Sometimes this is caused by a stale cache that needs to be refreshed with the `EXPIRE_CACHE=true` setting.  You may also try clicking the `Clean checkout` box in the GUI.

An error message caused by a stale cache is depicted below (subsequently fixed with `EXPIRE_CACHE=true`):
```

```

## Manual LDAP setup

The easiest way to setup LDAP boxes is to use an Umbrella (Terraform) scenario.  A workflow for this is provided below.

1) `cd` to the appropriate directory.
`$ cd /umbrella/chef-server/scenarios/aws`

2) Setup your credentials, create the vpc
```
$ okta_aws --all
Fetching credentials for: chef-engineering
Assuming AWS role Okta_AdministratorAccess...
Temporary credentials stored in profile chef-engineering
Credentials expire in 12 hours
$ make create-vpc
```
3) Run the external-openldap scenario, using this template.  Fill-in the blanks with your chosen platform, chef-server version, etc.  If you need to use manage, leave `ENABLE_ADDON_CHEF_MANAGE=true` as manage is not automatically installed.  Example:

$ PLATFORM=ubuntu-18.04 INSTALL_VERSION=14.11.21 UPGRADE_VERSION=14.11.21 SCENARIO=external-openldap ENABLE_ADDON_PUSH_JOBS=false ENABLE_GATHER_LOGS_TEST=false ENABLE_PEDANT_TEST=false ENABLE_PSQL_TEST=false ENABLE_SMOKE_TEST=false ENABLE_IPV6=false ENABLE_ADDON_CHEF_MANAGE=true MANAGE_VERSION=3.2.20 make apply | tee /tmp/out

4) LDAP sets up multiple boxes.  If you captured the scenario output with `tee /tmp/out` above, use the command below to discover the IP addresses for the boxes, and to determine which box is which (chef-server, or ldap). The box labeled in the text to the left as 'ldap_config' is the LDAP box.  The box labeled either 'chef_server_config' or 'chef_server_test' is the chef-server box.  Use the chef-server address for the manage web GUI.
```
$ grep Host: /tmp/out
null_resource.ldap_config (remote-exec):   Host: ec2-34-219-234-185.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
null_resource.chef_server_config (remote-exec):   Host: ec2-35-87-152-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
null_resource.chef_server_config (remote-exec): > Host: packages.chef.io
null_resource.chef_server_config (remote-exec):   Host: ec2-35-87-152-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
null_resource.chef_server_config (remote-exec): > Host: packages.chef.io
null_resource.chef_server_config (remote-exec):   Host: ec2-35-87-152-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
null_resource.chef_server_test (remote-exec):   Host: ec2-35-87-152-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
null_resource.chef_server_test (remote-exec):   Host: ec2-35-87-152-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
null_resource.chef_server_test (remote-exec):   Host: ec2-35-87-152-36.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

Notes.

If you've logged into a box via CLI, you can confirm which box it is by using this trick.  If it's the chef-server box, it will respond to `ctl` commands.  If it's the LDAP box, it won't:
```
$ chef-server-ctl status
run: bookshelf: (pid 18881) 405s; run: log: (pid 18478) 425s
run: elasticsearch: (pid 18862) 405s; run: log: (pid 18273) 468s
run: nginx: (pid 2572) 179s; run: log: (pid 18686) 413s
run: oc_bifrost: (pid 18736) 407s; run: log: (pid 18142) 480s
run: oc_id: (pid 18782) 406s; run: log: (pid 18183) 473s
run: opscode-erchef: (pid 18897) 404s; run: log: (pid 18601) 419s
run: postgresql: (pid 18722) 407s; run: log: (pid 17655) 492s
run: redis_lb: (pid 2278) 239s; run: log: (pid 18948) 404s
```
{{< note >}} From Chef Infra Server version 15.10.x onwards, we are using keydb instead of redis underneath. All the functions are supposed to work the same because keydb is a fork of redis. The configuration name and service name will continue to be redis_lb.{{< /note >}}

Note that the umbrella scenario automatically creates a `user1` account [ldap? chef-server?] with password `password`.

If you are using the manage web GUI along with CLI, for a quick knife setup click on the Administration tab, and click on 'Generate Knife Config' on the left.  Copy the 'config.rb' file to your current directory on the chef-server box, and issue the following:
```
alias knife='/opt/opscode/bin/knife'
export EDITOR=vim # edit this line to taste
knife ssl fetch
knife ssl check
```

## Using S3 instead of Bookshelf

If you would like to configure chef-server to use S3 instead of Bookshelf, you can
type (copy/paste) the following script into the bash shell of your chef-server.
This assumes you are using a root login.  Make obvious substitutions as needed, e.g.
`vip`, `external_url`, `s3_bucket`, `access_key_id`, etc:

```
# add the following to the bottom of /etc/opscode/chef-server.rb
echo "
bookshelf['enable'] =               false
bookshelf['vip'] =                  's3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'         # alter to taste
bookshelf['external_url'] =         'https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com' # alter to taste
opscode_erchef['s3_bucket'] =       'YOUR-BUCKET-HERE'
bookshelf['access_key_id'] =        'YOUR-ID-HERE'
bookshelf['secret_access_key'] =    'YOUR-SECRET-HERE'">>/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb

# put these values into /etc/environment
echo '
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR-ID-HERE"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR-SECRET-HERE"'>>/etc/environment

# reconfigure the system
chef-server-ctl set-secret bookshelf access_key_id YOUR-ID-HERE
chef-server-ctl set-secret bookshelf secret_access_key YOUR-SECRET-HERE
exit
sudo -i
chef-server-ctl reconfigure
chef-server-ctl stop opscode-erchef
chef-server-ctl start opscode-erchef
```
