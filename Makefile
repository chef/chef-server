# After the rebar3 upgrade from 3.6.2 to 3.20.0, license scout has issues
# with transitive dependencies referenced as packages in rebar.lock files.
# So, if we do a blanket upgrade of all dependencies (rebar3 upgrade --all),
# some transitive dependencies will be referenced as packages, causing license
# scout issues. Therefore, we upgrade only the dependencies that don't pull in
# transitive dependencies.
#
# To arrive at the list of dependencies to upgrade for an app, start with the
# deps in the rebar.config, and subtract from that anything pulling in a
# transitive dependency as seen by running a `rebar3 tree` in the appropriate
# directory. Problem dependencies in a lock file will be referenced by `pkg`,
# and will have an entry in a pkg_hash and possibly a pkg_hash_ext section at
# the bottom (the rebar.lock should not contain these entries).
#
# Anything pulling in a problem dependency, and any problem dependencies themselves,
# should be upgraded by hand.
#
# It was observed that upgrading a single dependency, e.g. `./rebar3 upgrade eper`,
# rewrote the entire lockfile, removing packages.  So if a lockfile ever gets
# inadvertently polluted, it's something to try.
