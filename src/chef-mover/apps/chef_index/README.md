Chef is a system integration framework written in erlang and ruby and designed to bring the benefits of configuration management to your entire infrastructure.

The Chef Wiki is the definitive source of user documentation.

This README focuses on developers who want to modify Chef source code.  For users who just want to run the latest and greatest Chef development version in their environment, see:

# DEVELOPMENT:

Before working on the code, if you plan to contribute your changes, you need to read the Opscode Contributing document.
You will also need to set up the repository with the appropriate branches. We document the process on the Chef Wiki.

    https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code.
