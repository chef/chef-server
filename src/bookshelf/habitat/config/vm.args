## Increase maximum IO ports from default (65536) to 196608
## This change helps bookshelf cope with bursty
## concurrent load
## Once we are on R16, we should use: +Q 196608
-env ERL_MAX_PORTS 196608

## Increase maximum concurrent Erlang process from
## default (262144) to 524288
## NOTE: This value MUST be a power of 2
## N band (N - 1) == 0
+P 524288

## Increase async worker thread pool size from
## R15 default of 0 to R16 default of 10.
## Async workers prevents IO from blocking the
## schedulers and increases performance of IO-heavy
## apps, like bookshelf.
