  Policyfile Object API (pre-release).

  Nodes have a many to one relationship with policies, based on their group
  and policy. A group is generally named after the functional role a host
  preforms, such as "appserver", "chatserver", "load balancer", etc. A group
  defines a set of hosts in a deployment unit, which may map to an
  organization's environments (e.g., dev, qa, staging, production), or may
  represent more granular phases (e.g., a change may go to a "canary" group,
  and then be rolled through various clusters within the production
  environment, so you'd have "prod-canary", "prod-cluster-1", etc.).

  Groups are ephemeral in the sense that they only exist when there is a
  policy applied to them.

  The API as described here functions similarly to the Policyfile
  compatibility mode which uses data bag items to store policies. It may be
  modified in the future, particularly to provide better support for
  describing collections of objects.

    At this time there is no collection functionality. All requests directly
    address a specific policy document, which is located at
    `/policies/:group/:policy`, relative to the chef server root URL.
