This is the database layer for chef.

Chef is a system integration framework written in erlang and ruby and designed to bring the benefits of configuration management to your entire infrastructure.

# DEVELOPMENT:

Before working on the code, if you plan to contribute your changes, you need to read the Opscode Contributing document.

    http://wiki.chef.io/display/chef/How+to+Contribute

You will also need to set up the repository with the appropriate branches. We document the process on the Chef Wiki.

    http://wiki.chef.io/display/chef/Working+with+git

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code.
