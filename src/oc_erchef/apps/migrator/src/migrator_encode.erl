%% The parse function of this module will convert an erlang term
%% representation of an DB operation as output by migrator_decode:parse/1
%% and convert it to a bnary SQL request suitable for use as a prepared
%% statement.  Note that the values included in the erlang terms are not
%% included in the statement - only bound parameter placeholders
%% ($1, $2 ... $n), suitable for use in prepared statements.
%
% Aside: a lot of the internal functions here can be consolidated.
%        I wrote them in get-it-done mode though, where copy-paste-modify
%        was the fastest path to working.

  % we build these prepared statements and have it tell us
  % what the PK is. This will likely become necessary as we expand functionalty
  % to include additoinal databases.
